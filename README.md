## Windows Troubleshooting

### "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file" Error

This error commonly occurs with PyInstaller-compiled executables on Windows. Here are solutions:

#### 1. Windows Defender / Antivirus

- **Right-click** the executable ‚Üí **Properties** ‚Üí **Unblock** (if checkbox exists)
- Add the executable to your antivirus **whitelist/exclusions**
- Temporarily disable **Real-time protection** in Windows Defender to test

#### 2. Run as Administrator

- **Right-click** the executable ‚Üí **Run as administrator**

#### 3. Alternative Download Methods

- Try downloading with a different browser
- Download to a different location (avoid Desktop/Downloads)
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+S` in browser to "Save As" instead of direct download

#### 4. PowerShell Execution Policy (for audio chimes)

If chime notifications don't work:

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### 5. SmartScreen Filter

If Windows SmartScreen blocks execution:

- Click **"More info"** ‚Üí **"Run anyway"**
- Or go to **Windows Security** ‚Üí **App & browser control** ‚Üí **Reputation-based protection** ‚Üí Temporarily disable

#### 6. File Location

- Move the executable to a folder like `C:\Tools\` instead of Desktop/Downloads
- Avoid paths with spaces or special characters
